Simple Task for a Go (Golang) Intern:
     Create a simple web server using Go: The intern should create a basic web
    server using the Go programming language that listens on a specific port and
    returns “Hello, World!” when a user accesses the root endpoint.

     Implement a basic CRUD API: The intern should create a basic CRUD (Create,
    Read, Update, Delete) API using Go that allows a user to manage a list of items
    (e.g., books, movies, etc.). The API should include endpoints for creating,
    reading, updating, and deleting items.
    "Books & Movies"

     Write a Go program to parse a CSV file: The intern should write a Go program
    that reads a CSV file and parses its contents into a data structure (e.g., a slice
    of structs). The program should then output the data in a formatted way (e.g.,
    as a table).
    "CSV Program that will take locally available csv file and then parse its content"

     Implement a concurrent program: The intern should write a Go program that
    performs a task concurrently using Goroutines and Channels. For example, the
    program could download multiple files from the internet at the same time.
    "Can make an API that can take different image URLs array, download them and then return those images using GET endpoint"
    "will also make a endpoint later that will return base64 encoded arrays of the API"
    "An API that will download the given file URLs locally or upload them to the given gDrive link"
