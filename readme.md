### Facing Issue
##### ? Conn busy
The app is deployed on render and sometimes it deploys multiple instances while managing its server leading to increased traffic either over the internal database or the server deployed. Please wait for 10 minutes or so and then retry. 

If issue still persists please contact over my mail: [loyaltytrooper@gmail.com](mailto:loyaltytrooper@gmail.com)
