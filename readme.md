# Zocket Task
<hr>

A postman collection has been shared in the repo root where each API request is explained in its respective comment.

### Facing Issue
##### (!) Conn busy || error {}
The app is deployed on [railway.app](railway.app) and many times you may face conn busy error when requesting over for movies or books CRUD APIs, for some reason after 2-3 successful requests this happens. Maybe because of the free tier. I also tried same primarily on [render.com](render.com) but faced same issues. Please wait for 10 minutes or so and then retry.

If issue still persists please contact me over my mail: [loyaltytrooper@gmail.com](mailto:loyaltytrooper@gmail.com)
